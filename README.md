## Overview

The ARKTIK MicroFarm is a 10×10 modular kit designed for backyard deployment. Hosts lease their land to ARKTIK (at \$50/month), granting full operational control while receiving:

* **10% of harvest** by weight or value
* **Interest-bearing stored-value credit** for rent payments

Students engage in no‑till organic cultivation, landscape design, and AI‑driven soil and pest analysis as part of ARKTIK Education’s hands‑on labs.

## Features

* **Modular Kit**: Plug-and-play irrigation, LED lighting, climate sensors, and AI camera modules
* **DIY Custom Kit**: Consultation-based custom kit purchasable at retail for independent assembly and maintenance
* **AI Subscription**: Optional subscription for AI-driven analysis & recommendations at a competitive monthly rate to ensure ROI and support stored-value returns
* **Sustainable Irrigation**: Water-timer integration with AI-driven evapotranspiration control
* **Regenerative Design**: No-till cover crops, soil-health focus, and biophilic aesthetics
* **Data-Driven Farming**: Real-time soil moisture, pH, and pest detection with automated alerts
* **Flexible Leasing**: 10×10 baseline plots or tiered discounts for larger areas
* **Value-Share Model**: Hosts receive 10–15% of yield plus yield on stored-value rent credits

## Lease & Revenue Model

1. **Land Lease**: ARKTIK pays \$50/month per 10×10 plot to hosts via stored‑value accounts earning APY.
2. **Crop Share**: Hosts receive 10% of each harvest. Tiered share increases (12–15%) for larger leased areas.
3. **Operator Revenue**: ARKTIK retains 85–90% of produce sales and may offer subscription services for remote monitoring.

## Prerequisites

* Backyard plot with access to water spigot
* Basic 110VAC power outlet (or solar option)
* Wi‑Fi or cellular connectivity for AI monitoring
* Homeowner agreement signed under ARKTIK Initiative terms

## Installation & Setup

1. **Unpack Kit**: Verify frame, LED modules, pump, sensors, and AI camera.
2. **Assemble Growth Unit**: Follow the Assembly & Installation Manual in `/docs`.
3. **Connect Utilities**: Attach water timer to spigot; plug control unit into power.
4. **Calibrate Sensors**: Use the web dashboard to configure soil‑moisture thresholds.
5. **Activate AI Module**: Register on ARKTIK Analytics platform and mount camera.
6. **Launch Irrigation**: Set baseline schedule; AI will adjust based on real‑time data.

## Usage

* **Monitor via Dashboard**: Access live feed, sensor logs, and irrigation reports.
* **Harvest Scheduling**: Receive alerts when plots reach optimal maturity.
* **Yield Accountability**: View yield metrics for share distribution and ROI tracking.

## Configuration

All settings are managed through the ARKTIK Analytics Dashboard:

* **Irrigation Rules**: Define moisture targets, rainfall delay, and manual override
* **Alerting**: Email/SMS notifications for system faults, pest outbreaks, or extreme weather
* **Lease Management**: View active plots, rent status, and stored-value balances

## Governance & Compliance

To maintain our 501(c)(3) educational nexus and prevent private inurement, ARKTIK has established the following safeguards:

* **Revenue Allocation**: 100% of net revenue from kit sales, AI subscriptions, and stored-value yield is directed to fund student scholarships and lab development, reinforcing the exemption’s educational purpose.
* **Private Benefit Limitations**:

  * Homeowners’ stored-value yields are capped at a uniform, reasonable rate for all participants.
  * Yield credits and subscription benefits are identical across homeowners and not tied to any governance or decision-making roles within ARKTIK.
  * Subscription fees and yield distributions are set at levels that prevent disproportionate private benefit and ensure any surplus supports charitable activities.

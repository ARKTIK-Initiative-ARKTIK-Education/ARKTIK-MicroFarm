## Sustainable Agriculture (AGRI-SUS-101)
<img src="../assets/ARKTIK%20Logo.png" alt="ARKTIK Logo" width="200">


**Course Description**
This introductory course examines sustainable agriculture as a socio-ecological system that balances environmental health, economic viability, and social equity. Learners explore principles and practices—from regenerative soil management to climate-smart water use and community food systems—through hands-on labs and case studies, reconnecting theory with field applications. ([CFAES][1], [National Agricultural Library][2])

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* **Define** sustainable agriculture and distinguish it from conventional models ([National Agricultural Library][2], [agricultureandfoodsystems.rutgers.edu][3])
* **Assess** soil-health indicators and implement regenerative practices for carbon sequestration ([Bioneers Learning][4], [Soil Health Academy][5])
* **Design** efficient water-management plans using climate-smart irrigation techniques ([SDG Help Desk][6])
* **Develop** integrated pest and weed control strategies that enhance on-farm biodiversity ([Inside TAMUC][7])
* **Plan** diverse polyculture systems that optimize yield and economic returns ([ag.santarosa.edu][8])
* **Evaluate** policy frameworks, market channels, and community models supporting local food security ([FAOHome][9])

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Foundations & Ethics of Sustainable Agriculture

Explore the legal definitions, historical context, and ethical imperatives of sustainable farming, emphasizing interconnections among ecology, economy, and society. ([National Agricultural Library][2], [agricultureandfoodsystems.rutgers.edu][3])

### Module 2: Regenerative Principles & Soil Health

Study regenerative agriculture concepts—biodiversity enhancement, cover cropping, no-till methods—and soil-health metrics that drive ecosystem resilience and carbon capture. ([Bioneers Learning][4], [Soil Health Academy][5])

### Module 3: Water Management & Climate-Smart Practices

Learn to design and implement irrigation systems that leverage soil-moisture sensing, weather-based scheduling, and efficient drip technologies to conserve resources under variable climates. ([SDG Help Desk][6], [ag.santarosa.edu][8])

### Module 4: Biodiversity, Pest & Weed Management

Examine ecological pest-management tactics, from beneficial insect habitats to crop rotations, reducing reliance on synthetic inputs while boosting farm resilience. ([Inside TAMUC][7], [agricultureandfoodsystems.rutgers.edu][3])

### Module 5: Polyculture Design & Economic Viability

Design mixed-crop plots (polycultures) that maximize space, optimize labor, and diversify income streams, supported by case studies in small-scale market production. ([ag.santarosa.edu][8], [Cornell CALS][10])

### Module 6: Policy, Community & Supply Chains

Analyze local, national, and global policy instruments, funding resources (e.g., USDA grants), and cooperative models that underpin equitable food-system development. ([National Agricultural Library][2], [FAOHome][9])

### Module 7: Advanced Topics & Special Environments

Investigate specialized systems such as wetland agriculture, agroforestry, and urban farming adaptations—exploring cross-sector cooperation and environmental management strategies. ([elearning.fao.org][11], [learning.eitfood.eu][12])

## Practical Labs & Fieldwork

* **On-Farm Field Trips**: Visits to local regenerative farms and research stations to observe sustainable practices in action. ([Cornell CALS][13])
* **Sensor Deployment**: Hands-on installation of soil-moisture, temperature, and pH probes, integrated into our MicroFarm kits for real-time monitoring. ([CFAES][1])
* **Design Workshops**: Student teams develop and present site-specific polyculture layouts, water-use plans, and biodiversity enhancement strategies. ([sustainableag.ca.uky.edu][14])
* **Data-Driven Analysis**: Use open-source tools to process sensor data and generate actionable insights, reinforcing the link between theory and practice. ([Soil Health Academy][5])

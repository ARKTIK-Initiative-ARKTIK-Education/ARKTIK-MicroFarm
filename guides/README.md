## 1. Quickstart Guide

### 1.1 Unboxing

* Verify kit contents against packing list (frames, ledges, fasteners, soil bag, seed starter pack).
* Inspect all components for damage.

### 1.2 Assembly

1. Lay out the frame pieces on a flat surface.
2. Join frames using interlock connectors per numbered diagram.
3. Secure seating ledges onto the frame with deck screws.
4. Level the assembled kit in its final location.

### 1.3 Initial Planting

* Fill planter cavity with supplied alkaline soil to 12" depth.
* Transplant starter seedlings according to planting grid (see diagram).
* Water thoroughly and confirm soil moisture.

## 2. Irrigation Setup & Troubleshooting

### 2.1 System Installation

1. Connect drip tubing to the manifold adapter.
2. Route tubing under soil, positioning emitters at root zones.
3. Attach manifold to garden hose or buried mainline via quick-connect.
4. Program timer for desired watering schedule (e.g., 3× per week).

### 2.2 Troubleshooting

* **No flow:** Check hose connection, timer batteries, and manifold valve position.
* **Uneven flow:** Clean or replace clogged emitters.
* **Leaks:** Tighten fittings or apply PTFE tape to threaded joints.

## 3. LED Lighting Installation

* Mount LED strips under seating ledges using adhesive backing.
* Route power cable along frame, securing with cable clips.
* Connect to a GFCI-protected outdoor outlet or low-voltage transformer.
* Test lights and set optional dimming controller, if applicable.

## 4. Crop Planning & Succession Calendars

| Crop Category   | Planting Interval | Harvest Window | Succession Plan                     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Leafy Greens    | Every 6 weeks     | 4–6 weeks      | Stagger plantings every 2 weeks     |
| Microgreens     | Every 1 week      | 7–14 days      | Continuous weekly sowing            |
| Herbs           | Every 8 weeks     | 6–8 weeks      | Replant immediately after harvest   |
| Root Vegetables | Every 10 weeks    | 8–10 weeks     | Alternate radish/carrot cycles      |
| Vine Crops      | Seasonal          | 12–16 weeks    | Plant once, with mid-season pruning |
